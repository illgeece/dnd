#### The Dream:

When Oz goes to sleep one night where he sleeps late he has a dream. You wake up slowly, opening and closing your eyes a few times before moving at all. You sit up slowly, seeing your hair falling in to cover your face in your peripheral vision. You look around the inn room as you stand up and head towards the bathroom at the opposite side of the room, its dark, the only morning light coming in a sliver between the drawn curtains, but your hair falls over your eyes as you get near the bathroom and you make no effort to brush it aside. As you head into the bathroom muscle memory guides you to the sink, you duck your head down and the magical plumbing runs some ice cold water into your hands. You splash your face and gain a sudden clarity, realizing your hands look a little smaller than usual and have a ring you don’t remember owning, as you look up and brush the carmel brown curls out of your face, revealing your green eyes, and see the face of a beautiful but unfamiliar woman staring back at you. You realize you are still in a dream when the face does not move to mirror your reaction at being transformed into a woman, instead staring into the mirror as the water drips down her face into the sink. A few moments pass as you look into the black orbs inside the pools of green in her eyes and then the woman turns back towards the room, wiping her face with the sleeve of her tunic as she exits and equips her armor with a few swipes of her hand. The woman walks towards the door and as she grabs the knob to leave the room, she hesitates, twisting her hand to reveal a porcelain white ring on her middle finger… she turns the doorknob and leaves the inn room she was staying in. You watch along as she walks down the spiral staircase around the trunk in the inn and shares an exchange with an older man and a younger guy with short blonde hair. They only speak a few words you cannot hear through the dream before she leaves out the front door of the inn. She steps out into the sunlight revealing a familiar sight in Lidour, and turns to the left walking slowly down the road. (A DC15 INS check will reveal a reluctance to walk forward, as if there is a magnet repelling her from where she is trying to walk) When after a hundred or so paces, the woman turns a corner into a shady alley between two trees, where a figure about her size stands seemingly cloaked in the darkness, with it draped onto the figure obscuring everything about them. The dark figure and the woman exchange a few words, and you watch as a slender white hand extends from the cloaked figure, holding a knife made of pure amethyst. The woman accepts it with a clenched fist, looking first at the distorted reflection of her face in the purple knife and then to the figure, who begins to fade away, revealing a small chin and a wide smile with a long, sharp canine tooth, disappearing into the darkness as you awake. 

  

#### The Summons:

When he wakes up from his sleep in wherever the guild are staying, Tater will alert Zuc to a letter addressed to him that was stabbed into the doorframe outside. The letter simply reads, “go east -B”. Either with the whole group or alone he should leave through the north gate and head towards the darkwood. Right after a random encounter planned by Beatrice, a DC15 PER check reveals her presence in the treeline ahead on the path. If noticed and called out Beatrice will walk out from the trees, but if not she will leap into the middle of the group and take Zuc hostage to see their response. Once she is done assessing them she will lead them a few hundred yards through the forest to a clearing in the darkwood where a camp of purple tents arranged in a semicircle around a larger purple tent, with a series of firepits, tanning racks, tables full of greens and other camp necessities sitting between the perimeter of guards in front of the group and the tents. The guards part wordlessly as Beatrice passes through but you can feel their eyes sticking to you hatefully as you walk by. Zuc recognizes a few faces as they walk through the camp to the large tent, where Rania stands attending at the front flap, her face turning in disgust when she sees Zuc behind Beatrice. Beatrice tells Rania to leave them, which she does reluctantly, and the group passes into the tent. 

It is a spacious tent without much in it, the wide open space in the middle basked in purple daylight. A bed and chest of drawers sits tucked into the far corner of the tent and the only other furniture in the area is a large table and standing diagram on the right side of the tent. Beatrice walks over to the table and sits in the single chair in the tent, kicking her boots up onto the table with a thud and pulling a wicked sharp shard of amethyst from her hair, picking her nails with it as she speaks: “So you’ve been having some fun (and you look the same/at least you don't look the same) as when I let you shamble out of my sight the first time. Playtime is done. The head witch has summoned all the priestesses, which can only mean one thing. The Incarnation Selection is going to be announced soon, you know what that means right?” if no “You were chosen as an incarnation of the Goddess, remember when we let you go so graciously? Well you aren’t the only one. Each of us priestesses selected one, but obviously there can only be one true Incarnation that can receive her powers. You will go with the other candidates to Colchis and only one of you all will return. Do you have any questions?... You have fifteen days to finish up all of your business here, after that we are going to whip you into shape so you won't completely embarrass me when the time comes. You all may stay here until the others arrive for the announcement this evening, but do not bother my sisters, I am not responsible for anyone who is flayed.” The group can leave her to flip her hairpiece in silence as she stares at the light filtering through the tent, reflecting off the shard of amethyst. 

The group heard about the pre tournament festival happening in the 

When they go outside they can rest at one of the firepits or at one of the tables that is set up in a clearing for dining. Looking around reveals the Medeans participating in all means of activity: archery, arm wrestling, chopping veggies presumably for a feast tonight, feeding horses, sparring in hand to hand combat, etc. The group can participate in an activity if they pass a DC10 CHA check, and improve their relationship with the campers. The campers may speak of some rumors going about:

- The Incarnation selection is an almost unheard of practice, so the entire camp is buzzing with the news that it could happen soon.
    
- The leader Circe will be coming personally which only adds to the excitement of the night as she never leaves Colchis.
    
- Some people think Beatrice is crazy for recruiting a man into the religion, much less making him incarnation, and think Circe is coming to punish her
    
- One of the priestesses (Jhestra) has been training her Incarnation for over fifteen years in hopes the selection would happen. 
    
- Some people say the Incarnation will be Medena’s host on the tower as she hasnt been seen in physical form for over two hundred years, while others say she will be Medena’s wife, or some say they will be the ones to move the living amethyst to another floor where its power could grow. 
    
- APRIL HAS: Knaves eyepatch
    

  

#### The Arrival of the Priestesses:

The feast begins before any of the other priestesses arrive. After about twenty minutes the first priestess arrives, and the excited murmur of the crowd betrays her identity as Jhestra, she walks in with about twenty followers, all women and all wearing the same dark purple robes as she and most of the women sitting around the group.
