Summary: with the help of a city guardsman with good hearing, the group tracks a high end smuggler named Davien Lestrine who is importing the body of a Lich to sell it to a group in Senora called VERIDIAN (Vanguard Exchange Relics Information Distribution Interchange Network) who aim to kill McCaffrey and take control of the water on the floor in order to unseat the monopoly the Argentum Trading Consortium has. 

The group walks past an alleyway and overhear (DC 10 PER) three thugs beating up on Albold, questioning him as to what he overheard. They will try to flee if injured to half health and if one sees two die he will drop his weapons and surrender. The thugs can be killed or if one is kept alive he will tell you that he works for Davien Lestrine before trying to escape again. This guy will have a piece of flint and steel in his pockets. Albold will tell the group he overheard with his good hearing the three breaking into a closed shop, discussing an important shipment that was going to secretly come into Lidour that night in a few hours. He was going to go find backup to apprehend them when he fell off the box he was peeking at them with and they discovered him and dragged him into the nearest alley.

#### Portefin’s Oddities: 

A lonely, two story store that is only open a few hours a day. Stone walls for the first story and wood walls for the second make it look like two houses stacked on each other. Only one entrance in front, a heavy wooden door that can be picked or smashed open. The windows are small, with only a few of them on either floor. The inside smells of dust and paper, the floorboards creaking with each step the players take. It is dark inside unless anyone summons light or lights either of the lamps on the sides of the room. The room is filled with tables covered with various items (GENERATE) that seem to be for sale but none are worth anything. A DC 14 INV check will find a lockbox (DC18 DEX DC15 STR) with 15G worth of jewels and rings. Upstairs is a single room with a table filled with candles, with another on the window opposite the door melted all the way down, chests with more wares, bookshelves etc. From the view of the window, the only thing that can be seen is the North River Gate. By intervening the players have stopped the lackey from lighting a new candle and letting the delivery ship know the delivery was ready to be received, so it will not come through the gate and nothing will happen that night. If the group puts a new candle in the window and lights it the Lich will arrive on time and the delivery will be complete unless they go to the riverbank, in that case 

Davien Lestrine: Powerful smuggler based in Bulham. 

- Looks: Med height, receding hairline, slicked back greasy black hair, 5 oclock shadow. 
    
- Does: suck on a lollipop, say “eeeeeeeasy”, speak w aussie accent
    
- Secret: addicted to gambling 
    

Alphene: Davien’s assistant, half elf he bought as a slave on a higher floor. 

- Looks: Pitch black hair cut just above her shoulders. Thin eyebrows and large eyes. 
    
- Does:
    
- Secret: She was sold to Davien by the Workshop, was one of the children sold into the experiments in Salazar.
    

#### Davien’s House: 

Grandiose house made of sandstone and cyprus, a wood that is not found on this floor. The house is equipped with an old-fashioned kitchen and one average bathroom, it also has a generous living/entertaining room, two bedrooms, a snug dining room and a roomy garage. The building is square shaped. The house is half surrounded by wooden overhanging panels.

The second floor is bigger than the first, which creates a stylish overhang around half the house. This floor has roughly the same style as the floor below. The roof is high, triangular and layered and is covered with rounded roof tiles. Two small chimneys sit at the side of the house. A few large windows let in just enough light to the rooms below the roof. There is a small basement accessible from stairs behind a bookcase in the living room where Davien stores his more important items. The house itself is surrounded by a modest garden, with mostly grass and a few small trees. There are 10 personal guards of Davien who only guard him and patrol the residence.

If the group approaches the gate to the house, they are met by three guards who ask their identities and what they want with Davien. When accused of smuggling without any evidence they will laugh it off but if the men or the shop is mentioned they show some signs of discomfort (DC10 INS). If they are pressed hard enough one will get a telepathic message from Alphine and allow them in to speak with Davien himself. 

Sneaking past the gate is possible by sneaking around the back to a broken part of the metal slats or vaulting it (DC15 ACRO). Once in the garden the ways into the house aside from the front door are: either chimney, the windows beneath the roof (either get on the roof or there is a small ledge under the windows where the second floor floor is (DC10 ATH) and take them off the frame (DC 16 DEX) or smash them), and a cellar door in the back that is locked and leads to the basement. 

Davien will be in the living room with Alphene and five more guards. If the group enters with his permission he will greet them with enthusiasm and ask what he can help them with. He claims to be a mine owner who thought they were there to invest in his mine (DC13 INS) and if confronted about the smuggling he laughs it off, there is no way to get him to admit to it here. A DC18 INV roll reveals the false bookcase and a 14 shows Davien flicking his eyes to one of his guys who leaves with an envelope sticking out his sword scabbard cord. Sticking around too long will anger Davien who will ask for the guards to kick them out. If Albold is with the group he will shout “you wont get away with this for long bastard!” and will swoon over Alphene, wanting to rescue her. 

  

#### Pursuing the messenger:

If the group leaves right after the messenger does, Davien will offer them some tea to stall them. 

If the group is delayed either by their own questioning or by Davien, they will have to track the guard using either INV or SUR (DC14) to get his tracks headed east. Otherwise they see the man dart around a corner headed east towards the center of the city. They follow him through the meandering street, and every time he reaches a corner (2 times if not delayed, 3 if so) he will look back prompting a stealth (DC14) or performance (DC12) roll to hide or act normal

A fail means he notices the tail and breaks into a run. Catching him requires a DC14 ATH roll and tackling him requires winning a strength contest (+0). If caught he will try and fight back but will quickly surrender if an attack hits him or misses them. He offers up the note and his limited information for his life. All he knows is he is supposed to leave the note in a hole in a tree outside the Greenleaf Brigade HQ and leave. The note reads: “TWOG READ TAKED… 9PM” which is an anagram for “Darkwood Gate… 9PM” signifying the land entrance to Lidour in the northern part of town, giving the players until 9 that night to prepare for the package's arrival. 

If the messenger gets away and the group cannot pursue them, they can follow his tracks and search 1d4 hours to find the tracks to the HQ where they can wait for Downing to pick it up. If they take the note and do not watch for Downing, he will go directly to Davien for the info and they will change the location again. 

  

#### Davien’s guard connect:

Davien is able to get all his stuff through the gate because he has one of the captains in the Greenleaf Brigade on his payroll, captain Downing, who he has known since he was first arrested in the town. When it comes time for a shipment to come through a gate, Downing will get his most lazy men and himself put on the shift and get them to slack off while the shipment comes in, killing ones who see and blaming the dark elves.

If the group goes to see him with Albold, they will be let in and he will receive Albold, thinking he came for a status report on —-. When the others are revealed he will yell at Albold for his incompetence in not getting any intel and then ask haughtily what they want. 

If the group does not go with Albold to the HQ they will need to convince the guard at the front door (10PER/13INT) to let them in or sneak in. When inside they will be made to wait for 1d6 half-hours before being admitted and asked what they want. 

If Downing is confronted with the fact that he took the note he will laugh, saying he was just receiving sensitive information about a dangerous mission, and if they show knowledge of the contents he will become visibly shaken and kick them out, having six of his creche members try and assassinate the group after they leave. 

If not he will prattle on about his accomplishments and if asked about Davien he will brush him aside, claiming to know of but not to have met him. 10INV reveals a map of Lidour half covered with a sheet of paper, with the location of the drop circled and -PM showing leaving the time obscured, and 15INV reveals —-. 

  

Captain Downing: captain of Albold’s creche 3 in the Greenleaf Brigade

- Looks: short silver hair, elaborate silver armor, long neck, pale skin
    
- Does: Yells in high pitched voice, asks for salute from everyone, cares about his rep more than anything 
    
- Secret: Loves prostitutes, especially young ones
    

  

#### The Delivery:

The delivery happens at 9PM, with the location depending on the previous actions. Davien will send 3 men with the coffin, Downing, and the VERIDIAN rep with a metal wagon with no horses will be there. It is a temperate night, moist with a heavy fog draping over the city, blocking out the treetops and limiting visibility to 60ft or so. 

If the coffin arrives over land it comes in a large wagon pulled by two horses. The wagon is made of dark wood and is very thin compared to its height, with certainly no space for any people to sit opposite each other inside of the hard wood covering in the back of the wagon. It comes to a stop just inside the gate before the horses freak out and break out of their harnesses and run off into the darkness back out the gate. Two of the three drivers go to the back and haul out the coffin while the first talks to the rep while Downing watches over them from the gate. There is a tree line to hide in as well as some small buildings and pieces of cover within earshot.

If the coffin comes through the river, it will be brought on a small black boat, and both Downing and the rep will have to use the lifting mechanism of the river gate at the same time to let the three men in. They will pull into the small inspection wharf right on the riverbank, haul the coffin off, and then push the boat out into the river. 

Once the coffin is off the boat/wagon the VERIDIAN rep will inspect it, and go to open it before being warned by the smuggler not to open it. He sets aside his dissatisfaction and singlehandedly drags the coffin into the wagon he brought with him and then hops in it and with a rumble it leaves. 

If combat is started, the first smuggler will rip off the coffin door when he realizes it is impossible to win and be killed by the life drain of the jiangshi before being resurrected by it as a wight. The Jaingshi will fight to the death and use the life drain on the nearest opponent when 50% or lower. The smugglers will take cover and try to shoot with arrows, fleeing at 50%. Downing will spend a turn looking panicked knowing anyone could see and if the battle turns against him he will betray the VERIDIAN rep and try and kill him and the smugglers in order to try and appease the group into letting him keep his position. The VERIDIAN rep will try and leave at the first sign of the battle going sour as soon as Downing attacks him, and will otherwise stay on the edge of combat casting spells (ice knife, spike growth, misty step). 

  

#### Davien’s Demise:

If the group goes straight to Davien’s after defeating the Jiangshi they find all of his guards refusing to let them in, with an even split inside and out. 

If they wait until morning, news of the failure of delivery will have reached him already whether from Downing, the rep, or one of his other sources. He will drop all pretense when the group arrives to the door and have all his guards escort them into the living room where he sits with dark circles under his eyes and a bunch of crumpled papers on the table in front of him and Alphene at his side. He angrily confronts the group about their involvement in thwarting the deal, wanting to know what their game is. If Downing is dead or it is revealed  he is part of the plot Davien will reveal he is under investigation by the Greenleaf Brigade, and if the VERIDIAN rep is dead he fears retaliation from VERIDIAN or the Argentum Consortium and will reveal that he plans to leave Lidour as soon as possible. If they try to bring him into jail or kill him he will fight back with all his guards but otherwise will not try and attack them. If they ask he can be persuaded/intimidated into giving them some money (800/1200G) or even freeing Alphene, and will give them information on VERIDIAN and what their motives were. If Downing is revealed as part of the conspiracy the Greenleaf Brigade leader may ask to meet the group and need help.
