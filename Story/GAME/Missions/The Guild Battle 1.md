Press Conference:
Location: The western side of Port Vale, in a large clearing by a two story farmhouse. It is a sunny, cool day with a slight breeze coming off the Blue Sea. The farmhouse is a large wooden building with a second story that is open to the air, with a short balcony exposing the bales of hay and various farming tools dotting the second story. The large field to the north of the building has a large earthen stage that seems to be constructed of magic, with stone steps leading up on either side to a perfectly sculpted dirt stage that is about 5ft tall. Already there are a few people milling about outside the farmhouse, player craftsmen peddling their wares through small stalls ringing the onlookers.
Approaching the stage, the group can see that Liberation, North Star, and Dragon are already there, with only a few people per guild there:
North Star: Yariel (mean), Hafner
Lib: Periel, Loki, Jake, 
Dragon:Yoon, Manreaver
They notice the main guilds first as they are standing directly under the stage talking to Thinker and Freywin, and only with a DC15 INS check can they determine the other guild's members in the crowd. 
If Icarus and Yoon see each other, they recognize each other and begin to have a conversation:
Y:Jakey!
J:Sighs, hello Martin.
Y: Wow, its so crazy to see you here, and you're still alive! That's so crazy.
J: *trying to play it cool* Oh *buddy* that is a good joke. Im actually the top player in the game, part of the strongest guild!
Y: Oh so your gamertag is Warden, thats you? Wow! *smug look*
J: *nervous* W..well no thats my buddy (point to Warden next to him if he is there) but you can see me on the top player rankings *puffs his chest out and pulls out scroll from his back pocket, points to his name on the list at #14*
Y: Whoa man thats so cool! *jake sets a smug smirk on his face* We're neighbors!
He points to his own name one place above Jakes, and Jakes smile immediately drops, as Yoon snickers
J: Just a stupid list anyways...
Y: *walks away* Good to see you haven't changed at all, looks like we don't need to worry about someone like you.
Jake and Yoon know each other through TikTok, they are both stars in the same niche (), but Yoon is like the asian version. He is also larger in following. 

Shadow Saints, Kevin Guild, and Hive show up right before the press conference begins, and once everyone shows then Thinker gathers the representatives of the guilds and asks who all is going to head up to the stage. They will let up to five people from each guild up but most only opt to let up two or so (Long Yoon, Hafner Yariel, Jake Periel, Kevin, Magichands, Censer). The crowd has filled up to a few hundred players as he takes the stage, holding a magical artifact fashioned of a rod with a gem on the end, holding it to his mouth like a microphone and begins to speak:
- Welcome to the guild battle
- Explains the tournament point scoring format
- Introduces the stages
- Talks about how viewers can watch
	- No watchability inside the obstacle course, everyone can watch the quiz, and there will be a viewing area inside the dungeon crawl that is for sale
- Introduces the guilds and their reps
- Asks for questions
	- For Yoon: Are you worried that someone will target you because you are so good looking and talented? I mean why cant we see what is going to happen in the obstacle course! *people start to chime in* What if something happens to you! *starts to cry*
	- A: Yoon stands up with a smile and says into the device in front of him, "dont you worry my lady" and snaps his fingers, creating a large puff of smoke in front of him largely obscuring his body, which you see vanish out of sight. Your eyes follow into the crowd to where the asker is standing to see him behind her with his arm around her shoulder and the crowd gasps in unison "you think I would let them get me, love?" and she swoons as the crowd cheers and he returns up to the stage. 
	- For Liberation guild: Can I join? 
	- A (periel): Yes.
	- For Hafner: Where's Lind? Is he really dead? (The crowd erupts in clashing shouts, some saying hes alive some saying hes dead)
	- A: *deep breath* The last weeks have seen the North Star name take some hits, we hear everything that is being said,  and with that in mind I want to make something clear. Lind still lives and is actually in private training as we speak, but even without him we are more than enough to point the way forward. *all NS members stand and start to leave*. Watch us. *He leaves*
	- For Ozymandias: *points at him* Uhhhh who are you? *crowd murmurs in assent*
	- For Zuc: 
	- For Asher: Do you really think you can just stand up there and say you want to clear the tower after all the people you've killed? You should step down and give yourself up to the Coalition- *the crowd starts to yell, members of the devastators start pushing the dissenters in the crowd* 
	- For Warden: Now that Lind and Kiba are *glances around and says tentatively* gone, who do you think is your greatest competition for the number one spot on the rankings?

Tournament Stages:
 **Obstacle Course**: a dungeon that has been cleared and various traps installed which a group of one player from each guild will enter at the same time and ecah will attempt to clear it the fastest and retrieve a gem at the end. combat between the players is forbidden but some players may use the terrain to obstruct others. 

**Starting Line**: Right outside the area of the press conference is a giant checkered flag stretched across two large wood posts, with a dirt trail stretching from the flag out to the temple in the distance. As the group moves over to line the sides of the posts they begin to chatter and those selected to be the starting group begin to line up, doing various stretches, waving to the onlookers... 
Participants: Shivata, Icarus, 40345234(Kevin), Nix (Shadow Saints), Marxas (Dragon)
At the other side of the finish line from the trail is Freywin, armed with a foot long metal tube that is hollowed at one end, which she points in the air, silencing the crowd. She takes a deep breath and shouts "THREE... TW-AAAAH" and slips on the dirt below her feet, falling back onto her butt and loosing a giant flare from the metal tube with a resounding WHOOM. She looks looks around frantically at the racers, then to the tube and back to them, and shouts **(MISS ALISSA START)** WELL GO! 
0.The field flat: A flat field of grass with a packed dirt trail, 100 yards exactly. Simple ATH check. 
ORDER: Shivata, Icarus, Marxas, 40345234, Nix
**1. The Collapsed Entrance (Perception & Athletics):**
* **Description:** The entrance is partially collapsed, with rubble and unstable walls. A narrow gap forces players to squeeze through.
* **Challenge:** DC 12 Strength check to clear a large stone, or DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to navigate the opening without being pinned.  A DC 10 Perception check reveals signs of a recent tremor. 
* **Effect:** Failure on either check results in 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
Shivata and Icarus get there first and start to clear stones with their hands but marxas gets there and breaks his shard, immediately spawning in a woman in mages robes, who peers into a crack in the doorway and teleports into the first room
ORDER: Marxas (way), Shivata, Icarus, 40345234, Nix

**2. The Shifting Floor (Dexterity & Intelligence):**
* **Description:** This chamber has a stone floor with deceptively placed pressure plates. Stepping on the wrong one triggers a trap.
* **Challenge:** Players must discern the pattern of the plates (DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check to identify a repeating sequence).  Each correct step triggers a short, harmless illusion (e.g., a ghostly figure flickers past).  Incorrect steps trigger a minor trap - a spray of ink (DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid becoming obscured) or a collapsing section of the floor (DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling 10 feet – 2d6 bludgeoning damage).
Marxas is sprayed with ink and 40345234 falls into a hole, Shivata runs along the wall and Icarus just runs over the top and collapses a stone floor but uses his air step
ORDER: Icarus, Shivata, Nix, Marxas, 40345234

**3. The Echoing Gallery (Perception & Wisdom):**
* **Description:** A long, rectangular hall with intricate carvings.  The echoes in the room are unsettling.
* **Challenge:** DC 15 Perception check to notice a faint, spectral hand reaching out from one of the carvings. This triggers a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) – failure leads to it grabbing you. 
Only Icarus and Shivata can 

**4. The Waterlogged Passage (Athletics & Dexterity):**
* **Description:** A narrow passage filled with ankle-deep water.  The current is surprisingly strong.
* **Challenge:** DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to wade through the current without being swept into a submerged alcove (containing a slippery slope - DC 13 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling 10 feet – 2d6 bludgeoning damage). Alternatively, players can attempt to find a stable foothold (DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check).

**5. The Rotating Chamber (Dexterity & Intelligence):**
* **Description:** A circular chamber with a central pedestal. The floor rotates slowly, making it difficult to maintain balance.
* **Challenge:**  The rotation is at a pace of 1/2 rotation per round. DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maintain balance. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check can reveal that the pedestal is actually a complex mechanism – pushing a hidden lever causes the rotation to speed up, potentially disorienting players (DC 14 Constitution saving throw to avoid being stunned for one round).

**6. The Guardian Spirit (Combat/Social):**
* **Description:** At the end of the course, a weakened Spirit of a Cartographer guards a small stone chest.
* **Challenge:** The Spirit attacks if provoked, or can be convinced to let the players pass if they answer a riddle about navigation correctly (DC 12 Intelligence (History) check to correctly state the god’s name, or a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to explain their intentions). 
* **Reward:** Inside the chest is the key artifact. 
**7. The Intervention of Nix**
- On the way back from the chest, whoever is in first will be noticed by Nix, who will exclaim "SHIT" and point his hand to the ceiling and shooting a fireball into the roof, causing the stone ceiling to partially collapse, leaving rubble up to nearly the ceiling. Shivata slides under a falling rock and Icarus leaps over the top of a large rock like a long jumper, but nobody else can get by. The runner can get by fairly easily with whatever tactic, leading to a final sprint against Shivata and Icarus. 

8. QUIZ: a test of intelligence and knowledge. One member from each team sits at a table with a magical button in front of each of them. 
A narrator reads a question aloud to the room and each player can slam their hand down on the button to answer. If the answer is wrong the player loses a point and it goes to the next to hit their button. A correct answer gets two points.
The other answerers will answer in five second intervals, with the first either happening within the first five or between 5-10 depending on the difficulty. 
If two people answer together in the same interval they must do an initiative contest to see who answers first.
