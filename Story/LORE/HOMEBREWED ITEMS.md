**Mandala**: 

**Camera**:

**Advanced Sending Stone**: Sending stone with no carvings but instead a few knobs on the front and some wires sticking out of it that can transmit voice as well as receive it simultaneously. Charges vary based on rarity. Workshop creation. 

Transmitting across floors is very difficult, the signal is lost most times, the only reliable way to have a phone call with people on different floors is to use a regular sending stone 

**Printing Press**: Basically a photo replicator, a bar with a charged wand inside casts color spray onto the paper in select intervals determined by the paper stacked above. Two flat surfaces with the moving wand apparatus in between, the old image goes on top and the blank paper or whatever goes on bottom. Workshop creation.
