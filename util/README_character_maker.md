## Tips & Best Practices

### Character Creation
- **Take your time** with the creation wizard - you can always edit later
- **Use default values** where appropriate by pressing Enter
- **Double-check ability scores** as they affect many other calculations
- **Set up spellcasting** properly if your character uses magic

### During Play
- **Use the combat reference** to quickly access important stats
- **Track HP changes** in real-time during combat
- **Monitor spell slot usage** to avoid surprises
- **Update conditions** and notes to track temporary effects

### Character Management
- **Regular backups** - copy your `characters.json` file occasionally
- **Descriptive names** - use clear character names to avoid confusion
- **Delete unused characters** to keep your list manageable

## Technical Details

### Calculations
- **Ability modifiers**: (Score - 10) Ã· 2 (rounded down)
- **Proficiency bonus**: 2 + (Level - 1) Ã· 4 (rounded down)
- **Skill modifiers**: Ability modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient)
- **Spell save DC**: 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier
- **Spell attack bonus**: Proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier

### Data Storage
- Characters stored in JSON format for easy reading/editing
- Automatic save on program exit and after major changes
- Each character is a complete, self-contained data structure
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"No characters found"**: Create a new character first
- **"Invalid input"**: Check that you're entering numbers where expected
- **"Character already exists"**: Choose a different name or load the existing character
- **"File not found"**: The program will create a new `characters.json` automatically

### Data Recovery
- If `characters.json` becomes corrupted, rename it and start fresh
- Always keep backups of your character file for important campaigns
- Characters can be manually edited in the JSON file if needed
